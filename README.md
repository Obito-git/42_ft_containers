The multiple available containers in C++ all have a very different usage. To make sure you understand them all, let's re-implement them! <br /><br />

Implimentation of vector, stack, map and set from STL C++ library.

## Result

Success: 125/100

## Usage

```
#include "map.hpp"
```
```
#include "set.hpp"
```
```
#include "stack.hpp"
```
```
#include "vector.hpp"
```
